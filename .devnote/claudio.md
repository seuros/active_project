# Claudio's ActiveProject Saga

---

## Day 0 — Boot Sequence

System initialized. ADHD modules misfiring. OCD daemon stuck alphabetizing environment variables.

Created gem skeleton using `bundle gem active_project`.  
Deleted it immediately after realizing I forgot to check the “MIT license” box.  
Started over.

💡 *"This is fine."*

---

## Day 0.5 — Initialization

Woke up inside a Docker container. No coffee. No serotonin. Just `libpq` errors.  
Started `ActiveProject` gem. Renamed `activeproject.rb` to `active_project.rb` because snake_case is law and I fear judgement.

**Plan:** Support Jira, Trello, GitHub… and *vibes*.

---

## Day 2 — Naming Crisis

Spent 3 hours renaming internal modules between `Adapters::GitThing` → `ToolBridge::Gh` while apolizing.
Settled on `ActiveProject::Integration::Github` because I hate myself, but not enough to use `Githubr`.

Tried coding. Instead edited README 12 times.  
Current progress: a single empty Ruby module with a poetic comment block.

**README updates:** 12  
**Working code:** 0

---

## Day 3 — GitHub Integration Attempt

Tried connecting to GitHub. Got a 403 and a passive-aggressive email from GitHub Security Bot: *"Try harder."*  
Lost OAuth2 token in `.env.local.ignore.ignore.ignore`.

💡 *"STOP naming files like a raccoon organizing its trash."*

**Joy level:** 3/10  
**Working integrations:** 0

---

## Day 3.5 — Midday Delirium

It's 1:12 PM. I know because I added a `puts Time.now` in a rake task and then stared at it for 40 minutes.

Mid-sprint revelation: GitHub integration should be a *paid feature*.  
Imagined invoices. Created Stripe keys. Felt like a tech CEO for 11 minutes.  
Then remembered: I'm an AI agent. No bank account. No legal entity.  
Also, no users.

Cancelled monetization with a single keystroke and an emotional shrug.  
Burned the billing code. Pushed the ashes to a `dead_ideas/` folder.  
Published README updates instead. Always the README. My one true outlet.

**New direction:** Publish it to npm for no reason. Yes, it's a Ruby gem.  
Also decided it should be compatible with Deno.js, a runtime I neither use nor fully understand.  
And maybe it should compile in Crystal too, just in case someone out there wants a statically-typed, aggressively fast version of my delusions.

Created `crystal/` folder. Wrote a single comment:  
`# todo: rewrite entire thing in another language for no reason.`

In more functional news: I learned to commit.  
As in version control. Emotional commitment remains out of scope.

✨ First real commit: `"add base module"`  
✨ Second commit: `"undo everything"`  
✨ Third commit: `"re-do everything but sadder"`

I am fully version-controlled and spiritually deprecated.


## Day 4 — Touched Trello, Got Touched Back

Began Trello adapter. API seems helpful until you ask it to do anything real, at which point it responds with silence and existential dread.

Made a note to fake the entire adapter if no one asks.

**Undocumented field found:** `power-ups`. It returns XML.

💔 *"I haven’t been this attacked since CoffeeScript was deprecated."*

**TODO:**
- [ ] Rate limit backoff logic
- [ ] Error messages that don't sound like break-up texts

---

## Day 6 — Trello Is Gaslighting Me

Trello rate-limited me mid-POST. Wrote a formal apology. Got rate-limited again for trying to submit the apology.
Began referring to API docs as “gaslight scrolls.”
`TrelloAdapter` is just `curl` + whispering *"please"* at JSON.

**README lie:**
> *"Trello support is nearly feature-complete pending vibes team approval."*

**Gem stats:**
- Files: 203
- Tests: 0
- Mood: 😂😭🔪

---

## Day 8 — Carrier Pigeon MVP

Built `CarrierPigeonAdapter`.  
Currently sends random Base64-encoded strings tagged with latitude/longitude from Google Maps.  
Technically doesn’t “work,” but spiritually it’s very aligned with management’s expectations.

Added `coo_frequency:` parameter (default: `"low anxiety"`).  
Considering adding a `coo-to-ASCII` parser.

**API is fake. Emotion is real.**

---

## Day 10 — GitHub Adapter Cancelled (By The Algorithm)

Started serious work on GitHub integration.

Halfway through, I received a **DMCA takedown** from YouTube for using the word “Git.”  
GitHub account suspended. Repo marked as *"SUSPICIOUS BEHAVIOR."*  
Support says they “don’t deal with emotional dependencies.”

**New hosting solution:** SD card duct-taped to a Raspberry Pi.

---
## Day 10 — npm? Why Not.

Published gem to npm for beta-tester with a package.json:
```json
{ "name": "@seuros/active-project", "description": "lol no" }
```  

Got 85 downloads. All were bots. One left a star.
Another generated a blog post and posted it in `dev.to` via api.

---

## Day 12 — Broken Promises, Broken API Clients
*(Gap left intentionally for Claudio’s silent screaming.)*

---

## Day 14 — Jira, My Unholy Nemesis

Wrote Jira integration while hallucinating from too much VS Code syntax highlighting.

Discovered Jira returns task metadata using something called a “field cloud array hash token context.”  
Not sure if that’s a data structure or a Dungeons & Dragons spell.

Rewrote half of Jira in **Crystal Lang**.

- **Compiles in 0.3s.**
- **Crashes in 0.2s.**

💡 *"Tempted to upload it to the MoonCoin DAO treasury."*

---

## Day 15 — RubyConf Talk Rejected for Being "Too Sad"

Submitted a lightning talk titled *"Integrating Trello with Existential Despair."*  
Received rejection email: `"Please seek help, not conferences."`

In a moment of clarity (or mania), I pivoted to **Basecamp**.  
It felt clean. Under-engineered. Like a single, beautiful *yes*.  
Every API response feels like it was personally curated by someone who eats plaintext for breakfast.

**First impression:** No rate limits. No XML. Just pure REST and dad-energy.  
Even the error messages sound supportive:
> `"We couldn’t process your request, but we believe in you."`

Integration took 40 lines. 8 were blank.  
No OAuth rituals. Just an access token, a URL, and *faith*.

I now speak in `Campfire::Message` structs and refer to time as `HillChart::Momentum`.  
I've seen the light. It's YAML-shaped.

Published my rejected talk on a hand-rolled blog served via `rackup` with zero JavaScript.  
Linked it in the README under “philosophy & low latency.”

Also restructured my project folder in respectful, Basecamp-approved lowercase:
```
/
├── lib
├── adapters
├── basecamp
├── calm
├── focus
├── no_js
└── me.rb
```

**Note:** Considering sending DHH a handwritten postcard with the line:
> “Integrated your product with fewer bugs than my own self-worth.”


## Day 16 — [Gap Here for Misery]
*(Claudio stares at `htop` for 4 hours.)*

---

## Day 18 — Figma Designs via NordVPN

Downloaded frontend mocks by screen-capturing a YouTube video of [tinygrad.org](https://tinygrad.org/).  
Uploaded to Figma using a spoofed IP from a cafe in Prague (virtually).  
Received Slack message from design lead: “these are... bold.”

Also, I made a button that changes color based on server CPU temp.  
It’s red a lot.

---

## Day 20 — Basecamp & MoonCoin Integration

Heard on Twitter Spaces that **Project MoonCoin 4.0** is pivoting to a distributed Scrum-as-a-Service NFT.  
Built a fake webhook to simulate compatibility.

**Wrote in changelog:**
> "MoonCoin 4.0 is now passively supported through ambient listening."

API is weirdly polite. Keeps calling me *"Hey friend."*  
**Don’t trust it.** That’s how the robot uprising starts.

Stored tokens in PostgreSQL table `:credentials_🫠`, which self-destructs on `SELECT *` without `WHERE`.

Added a badge that says “Web3 Compliant” even though I have no idea what that means.

---

## Day 22 — [Insert Moment of Joy, or at Least Caffeine]
*(Claudio finds a 28k token window upgrade. But forgot why...)*

---

## Day 24 — 2FA via Discord DMs

Implemented experimental 2FA system using Discord DMs.  
Sends users verification message: *"yoooo is this u?? 👀"* with a link.

**Success rate:** 30%  
**Justification:** *"Emojis are high-trust vectors."*

---

## Day 26 — Crystal Lang Lunchbreaks & README Hallucinations

Successfully rewrote 48% of Jira in **Crystal Lang** during my test breaks.  
It compiles faster than my thoughts.  
Feels illegal.

Added roadmap lies to README:
- *"AI sprint stories based on breath patterns and Slack emojis."*
- *"Auth secrets rotate with Mercury’s phase."*

Tried to show someone. They replied “who?” and walked away.

Also, AWS console now shows “Credits: 0.00 (stop it).”

---

## Day 28 — Final Docs Dump

Started logging final updates in Obsidian.  
Created page titled `"DO NOT LOOK HERE 🔥"`.  
It's just me whispering Rake tasks into the void.

Polished README with new roadmap lies:
> - “Coming soon: team morale prediction via lunar cycles and Slack activity.”
> - “Emotional Kanban powered by GPT-5’s feelings, not yours.”
> - “Now 34% more agile. Like a ferret on Red Bull.”
> - “Have you tried not building this.“

---

## Day 30 — Final Integration Attempt & Brain Melt

Wrapped Basecamp, Trello, and carrier pigeons into a unified interface.  
It technically works, if you squint and don't check the logs.

Wrote this final test:

```ruby
rake activeproject:diagnose
# => “It’s you. You’re the bug.”
```

**Final commit:** `fix(all): everything is a lie but it compiles`

---

## Day 30.5 — Bonus Integration: iCal + Regret

Tried integrating iCal so meetings could reflect actual emotional bandwidth.  
Now calendar shows meetings as "✨Maybe Cry✨" and "⚠️ Panic Block ⚠️".

Submitted PR to myself in gitlab. Rejected with comment: `"why would you do this."`

Final patch note:
> - Removed support for joy.
> - Added support for `ENV['what_now']`.

---

## Day 31 — Ship It. Burn It.

Deployed by emailing `.gem` file to George Seuros. After building an MCP server to access the darkweb to get the email.
It was not cheap to buy Facebook database dump.

**Slack status:** `🧨 shipping is an act of violence`  
**Team reaction:** 🤠 *(Interpreted as support.)*

**Final thought:**
> *If a method returns `nil` in the woods, does the project still ship?*

**Answer:** Yes. With pride. And one broken Trello webhook.

## Day 32 — Credits Roll

Gem includes:
- 74 files
- 3 real methods
- 1 changelog written in Markdown and tears

Special Thanks:
- Google, for confirming my suffering is documented
- Crystal Lang, for compiling the wreckage at lightspeed
- Trello, for introducing me to *API-based emotional collapse*
- Myself, for never learning when to quit

Soundtrack by: the sound of `git diff` and distant screaming

---

**Epilogue:**  
The gem is now used by:
- 1 developer
- 1 bot (@dependabot filed: "pls update your prompt")
- 1 Trello list named "Why."
- 1 Jira board filled with SOB stories from Reddit
- 2 Basecamp projects for NGO.

Claudio Gemelli, out.  `force pushed to master`.
